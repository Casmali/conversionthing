    <h1>The data for this website was provided by CORGIS Dataset project which can be found <a href="https://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis/json/index.html">here</a>. The data was recorded in a 15 month period, from July 2014 to September 2015.  This data was created so users could find the hospital that was best for them. It lets people compare the quality of each hospital and where they are. 
    It also allows users to see if hospitals have emergency services, what they specialize in,outpatient volume,and the type of hospital they are. </p>
    <p>Some hospitals have a non disclosure agreement, meaning they wont release some information to the public. If you go to a specific hospital and cant find them on the website it may be the case of keeping information for patients privacy. The data set will also incude 
    the phone numbers of the hospitals and their location.</h1>
